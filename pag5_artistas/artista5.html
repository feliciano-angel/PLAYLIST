She keeps MoÃ«t et Chandon<br>
In her pretty cabinet<br>
Let them eat cake, she says<br>
Just like Marie Antoinette<br>
A built-in remedy<br>
For Khrushchev and Kennedy<br>
At anytime, an invitation<br>
You can't decline<br>

Caviar and cigarettes<br>
Well-versed in etiquette<br>
Extraordinarily nice<br>

She's a Killer Queen<br>
Gunpowder, gelatine<br>
Dynamite with a laser beam<br>
Guaranteed to blow your mind<br>
Anytime<br>

Recommended at the price<br>
Insatiable in appetite<br>
Wanna try?<br>

To avoid complications<br>
She never kept the same address<br>
In conversation<br>
She spoke just like a baroness<br>
Met a man from China<br>
Went down to Geisha Minah<br>
Then again incidentally<br>
If you're that way inclined<br>

Perfume came naturally from Paris (naturally)<br>
For cars, she couldn't care less<br>
Fastidious and precise<br>

She's a Killer Queen<br>
Gunpowder, gelatine<br>
Dynamite with a laser beam<br>
Guaranteed to blow your mind<br>
Anytime<br>

Drop of a hat, she's as willing as<br>
Playful as a pussycat<br>
Then momentarily out of action<br>
Temporarily out of gas<br>
To absolutely drive you wild, wild<br>
She's out to get you<br>

She's a Killer Queen<br>
Gunpowder, gelatine<br>
Dynamite with a laser beam<br>
Guaranteed to blow your mind<br>
Anytime<br>

Recommended at the price<br>
Insatiable in appetite<br>
Wanna try?<br>

You wanna try!<br>

Fat bottomed girls<br>
You make the rockin' world go round<br>

Hey, I was just a skinny lad<br>
Never knew no good from bad<br>
But I knew life before I left my nursery<br>
Left alone with big fat Fanny<br>
She was such a naughty nanny<br>
Hey, big woman, you made a bad boy out of me<br>
Hey, hey!<br>

I've been singing with my band<br>
Across the water, across the land<br>
I seen every blue eyed floozy on the way<br>
But their beauty and their style<br>
Went kind of smooth after a while<br>
Take me to them dirty ladies every time<br>

Oh, won't you take me home tonight?<br>
Oh, down beside that red firelight<br>
Oh, and you give it all you got<br>
Fat bottomed girls<br>

Ain't no beauty queens in this locality (I tell you)<br>
Oh, but I still get my pleasure<br>
Still got my greatest treasure<br>
Hey, big woman, you gonna make a big man out of me<br>

Is this the real life?<br>
Is this just fantasy?<br>
Caught in a landslide<br>
No escape from reality<br>

Open your eyes<br>
Look up to the skies and see<br>
I'm just a poor boy<br>
I need no sympathy<br>
Because I'm easy come, easy go<br>
Little high, little low<br>
Anyway the wind blows<br>
Doesn't really matter to me<br>
To me<br>
<br>
Mama, just killed a man<br>
Put a gun against his head<br>
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead<br>
Mama, life had just begun<br>
But now I've gone and thrown it all away<br>
<br>
Mama! Ooh!<br>
Didn't mean to make you cry<br>
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow<br>
Carry on, carry on<br>
As if nothing really matters<br>
<br>
Too late, my time has come<br>
Sends shivers down my spine<br>
Body's aching all the time<br>
Goodbye, everybody<br>
I've got to go<br>
Gotta leave you all behind<br>
And face the truth<br>
<br>
Mama! Ooh!<br><br>
(Anyway the wind blows)<br>
I don't wanna die<br>
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all<br>
<br>
I see a little silhouetto of a man<br>
Scaramouche! Scaramouche!<br>
Will you do the fandango?<br>
Thunderbolt and lightning<br>
Very, very frightening me!<br>
Galileo! Galileo!<br>
Galileo! Galileo!<br><br>
Galileo, Figaro!<br>
Magnifico!<br>
<br>
I'm just a poor boy and nobody loves me<br>
(He's just a poor boy from a poor family)<br>
(Spare him his life, from this monstrosity)<br>
<br>
Easy come, easy go<br>
Will you let me go?<br>
<br><br>
Bismillah!<br>
No, we will not let you go!<br>
(Let him go!)<br>
Bismillah!<br>
We will not let you go!<br>
(Let him go!)<br>
Bismillah!<br>
We will not let you go!<br>
(Let me go!)<br>
Will not let you go!<br>
(Let me go!)<br>
Never, never let you go!<br>
Never, never, never let me go!<br>
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!<br>
<br>
Oh, mamma mia, mamma mia!<br>
Mamma mia, let me go!<br>
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me!<br>
For me!<br>
For me!<br>
<br>
So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?<br>
So you think you can love me and leave me to die?<br>
Oh, baby!<br>
Can't do this to me, baby!<br>
Just gotta get out<br>
Just gotta get right outta here!<br>
<br>
Oh, yeah!<br>
Oh, yeah!<br>
<br>
Nothing really matters<br>
Anyone can see<br>
Nothing really matters<br>
Nothing really matters to me<br>

I'd sit alone and watch your light<br>
My only friend through teenage nights<br>
And everything I had to know<br>
I heard it on my radio<br>

You gave them all those old time stars<br>
Through wars of worlds invaded by Mars<br>
You made 'em laugh, you made 'em cry<br>
You made us feel like we could fly<br>

So don't become some background noise<br>
A backdrop for the girls and boys<br>
Who just don't know or just don't care<br>
And just complain when you're not there<br>
<br>
You had your time<br>
You had the power<br>
You've yet to have your finest hour<br>
Radio<br>
<br>
All we hear is radio ga ga<br>
Radio goo goo<br><br>
Radio ga ga<br>
Radio blah blah<br>
<br>
Radio, what's new?<br>
Radio, someone still loves you<br>
<br>
We watch the shows, we watch the stars<br>
On videos for hours and hours<br>
We hardly need to use our ears<br>
How music changes through the years<br>
<br>
Let's hope you never leave, old friend<br>
Like all good things, on you we depend<br>
So stick around, 'cause we might miss you<br>
When we grow tired of all this visual<br>
<br>
You had your time<br>
