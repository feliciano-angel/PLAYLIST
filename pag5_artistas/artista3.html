I'm going back to 505<br>
If it's a seven hours flight<br>
Or a forty-five minute drive<br>
In my imagination<br>
You're waiting lying on your side<br>
With your hands between your thighs<br><br>

Stop and wait a sec<br>
When you look at me like that<br>
My darling, what did you expect?<br>
I probably still adore you<br>
With your hands around my neck<br>
Or I did last time I checked<br><br>

I'm not shy of a spark<br>
The knife twists at the thought<br>
That I should fall short of the mark<br>
Frightened by the bite<br>
No, it's no harsher than the bark<br>
A middle of adventure<br>
Such a perfect place to start<br><br>

I'm going back to 505<br>
If it's a seven hour flight<br>
Or a forty-five minute drive<br>
In my imagination<br>
You're waiting lying on your side<br>
With your hands between your thighs<br><br>

But I crumble completely when you cry<br>
It seems like once again you've had to greet me with goodbye<br>
I'm always just about to go and spoil the surprise<br>
Take my hands off of your eyes too soon<br><br>

And a smile<br>

You used to get it in your fishnets<br>
Now you only get it in your night dress<br>
Discarded all the naughty nights for niceness<br>
Landed in a very common crisis<br>
Everything's in order in a black hole<br>
Nothing seems as pretty as the past though<br>
That Bloody Mary's lacking her Tabasco<br>
Remember when you used to be a rascal?<br><br>

Oh, that boy's a slag<br>
The best you ever had<br>
The best you ever had<br>
Is just a memory and those dreams<br>
Weren't as daft as they seem<br>
Not as daft as they seem<br>
My love, when you dreamed them up<br><br>

Flicking through a little book of sex tips<br>
Remember when the boys were all electric?<br>
Now when she's told she's gonna get it<br>
I'm guessing that she'd rather just forget it<br>
Clinging 'til I'm getting sentimental<br>
Said she wasn't going but she went still<br>
Likes her gentlemen to not be gentle<br>
Was it a Mecca dobber or a betting pencil?<br><br>

Oh, flo<br>
Where did you go?<br>
Where did you go?<br>
Where did you go? Oh<br><br>

Falling about<br>
You took a left off Last Laugh Lane<br>
Just sounding it out<br>
But you're not coming back again<br><br>

You used to get it in your fishnets (falling about)<br>

Arabella's got some interstellar-gator skin boots<br>
And a helter skelter around her little finger and I ride it endlessly<br>
She's got a Barbarella silver swimsuit<br>
And when she needs to shelter from reality<br>
She takes a dip in my daydreams<br><br>

My days end best when this sunset gets itself behind<br>
That little lady sitting on the passenger side<br>
It's much less picturesque without her catching the light<br>
The horizon tries, but it's just not as kind on the eyes<br>
As Arabella, oh<br>
As Arabella<br><br>

Just might have tapped into your mind and soul<br>
You can't be sure<br><br>

Arabella's got a 70's head<br>
But she's a modern lover<br>
It's an exploration, she's made of outer space<br>
And her lips are like the galaxy's edge<br>
And her kiss, the color of a constellation falling into place<br><br>

(That's magic) in a cheetah print coat<br>

(Wraps her lips) 'round a Mexican coke<br>

(Takes a sip) of your soul and it sounds like<br><br>

What’s been happening in your world? Oh<br>
What have you been up to?<br>
I heard that you fell in love<br>
Or near enough<br>
I gotta tell you the truth<br><br>

I wanna grab both your shoulders and shake, baby<br>
Snap out of it (snap out of it)<br>
I get the feeling I left it too late, but baby<br>
Snap out of it (snap out of it)<br>
If that watch don’t continue to swing<br>
Or the fat lady fancies having a sing<br>
I’ll be here waiting ever so patiently for you to<br>
Snap out of it<br><br>

Forever isn’t for everyone<br>
Is forever for you?<br>
It sounds like settling down or giving up<br>
But it don’t sound much like you, girl<br><br>

I want to grab both your shoulders and shake, baby<br>
Snap out of it (snap out of it)<br>
I get the feeling I left it too late, but, baby<br>

Under a spell, you’re hypnotized (oooh)<br>
Darling, how could you be so blind? (Snap out of it)<br>

I'm a puppet on a string<br>
Tracy Island, time-traveling<br>
Diamond cutter-shaped heartaches<br>
That come to find you four in some velvet morning<br>
Years too late, she's a silver lining<br>
Lone ranger riding through an open space<br>
In my mind, when she's not right there beside me<br>

I go crazy, 'cause here isn't where I wanna be<br>
And satisfaction feels like a distant memory<br>
And I can't help myself, all I<br>
Wanna hear her say is: Are you mine?<br>
Well, are you mine?<br>
Are you mine?<br>
Are you mine? Alright<br>

I guess what I'm trying to say is I need the deep end<br>
Keep imagining meeting, wished away entire lifetimes<br>
Unfair we're not somewhere misbehaving for days<br>
Great escape, lost track of time and space<br>
She's a silver lining, climbing on my desire<br>

And I go crazy, 'cause here isn't where I wanna be<br>
And satisfaction feels like a distant memory<br>
And I can't help myself, all I<br>
Wanna hear her say is: Are you mine?<br>
Well, are you mine? (Are you mine tomorrow?)<br>
Are you mine? (Or just mine tonight?)<br>
Are you mine? (Are you mine, mine?)<br>

And the thrill of the chase moves in mysterious ways<br>
So in case I'm mistaken, I<br>
Just wanna hear you say: You got me, baby<br>
Are you mine?<br>
