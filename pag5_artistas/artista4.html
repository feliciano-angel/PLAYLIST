Finished with my woman 'cause she<br>
Couldn't help me with my mind<br>
People think I'm insane because<br>
I am frowning all the time<br>
<br>
All day long, I think of things<br>
But nothing seems to satisfy<br>
Think I'll lose my mind if I don't<br>
Find something to pacify<br>
<br>
Can you help me<br>
Occupy my brain?<br>
Whoa, yeah<br>
<br>
I need someone to show me<br>
The things in life that I can't find<br>
I can't see the things that make true happiness<br>
I must be blind<br>
<br>
Make a joke and I will sigh<br>
And you will laugh and I will cry<br>
Happiness, I cannot feel<br>
And love to me is so unreal<br>
<br>
And so, as you hear these words<br>
Telling you now of my state<br>
I tell you to enjoy life, I wish I could<br>
But it's too late<br>

Oh, yeah<br>
<br>
Some people say my love cannot be true<br>
Please, believe me, my love, and I'll show you<br>
I will give you those things you thought unreal<br>
The Sun, the Moon, the stars, all bear my seal<br>
<br>
Oh, yeah<br>
<br>
Follow me now and you will not regret<br>
Leaving the life you led before we met<br>
You are the first to have this love of mine<br>
Forever with me till the end of time<br>
<br>
Your love for me has just got to be real<br>
Before you know the way I'm going to feel<br>
I'm going to feel<br>
I'm going to feel<br>
<br>
Oh, yeah<br>
<br>
Now I have you with me under my power<br>
Our love grows stronger now with every hour<br>
Look into my eyes, you'll see who I am<br>
My name is Lucifer, please, take my hand<br>
<br>
Oh, yeah<br>

Follow me now and you will not regret<br>
Leaving the life you led before we met<br>

Generals gathered in their masses<br>
Just like witches at black masses<br>
Evil minds that plot destruction<br>
Sorcerers of death's construction<br>
<br>
In the fields, the bodies burning<br>
As the war machine keeps turning<br>
Death and hatred to mankind<br>
Poisoning their brainwashed minds<br>
Oh, Lord, yeah!<br>
<br>
Politicians hide themselves away<br>
They only started the war<br>
Why should they go out to fight?<br>
They leave that all to the poor, yeah!<br>
<br>
Time will tell on their power minds<br>
Making war just for fun<br>
Treating people just like pawns in chess<br>
Wait till their judgment day comes, yeah!<br>
<br>
Now, in darkness, world stops turning<br>
Ashes where their bodies burning<br>
No more war pigs have the power<br>
Hand of God has struck the hour<br>
<br>
Day of Judgment, God is calling<br>
On their knees, the war pigs crawling<br>
Begging mercies for their sins<br>
Satan, laughing, spreads his wings<br>
Oh, Lord, yeah!<br>

I feel unhappy<br>
I feel so sad<br>
I've lost the best friend<br>
That I ever had<br>
<br>
She was my woman<br>
I loved her so<br>
But it's too late now<br>
I've let her go<br>
<br>
I'm going through changes<br>
I'm going through changes<br>
<br>
We shared the years<br>
We shared each day<br>
In love, together<br>
We found the way<br>
<br>
But soon, the world<br>
Had its evil way<br>
My heart was blinded<br>
Love went astray<br>
<br>
I'm going through changes<br>
I'm going through changes<br>
<br>
It took so long<br>
To realise<br>
And I can still hear<br>
Her last goodbyes<br>
<br>
Now, all my days<br>
Are filled with tears<br>
Wish I could go back<br>
And change these years<br>
<br>
I'm going through changes<br>
I'm going through changes<br>
