See me ride out of the sunset<br>
On your color TV screen<br>
Out for all that I can get<br>
If you know what I mean<br><br>

Women to the left of me<br>
And women to the right<br><br>

Ain't got no gun<br>
Ain't got no knife<br>
Don't you start no fight<br><br>

'Cause I'm TNT, I'm dynamite<br>
(TNT) and I'll win the fight<br>
(TNT) I'm a power load<br>
(TNT) watch me explode<br><br>

I'm dirty, mean and mighty unclean<br>
I'm a wanted man<br>
Public enemy number one<br>
Understand?<br><br>

So lock up your daughter<br>
Lock up your wife<br>
Lock up your back door<br>
Run for your life<br><br>

The man is back in town<br>
So don't you mess me 'round<br><br>

'Cause I'm TNT, I'm dynamite<br>
(TNT) and I'll win the fight<br>
(TNT) I'm a power load<br>
(TNT) watch me explode<br><br>

(TNT) oi, oi, oi!<br>

Back in black, I hit the sack<br>
I've been too long, I'm glad to be back<br>
Yes, I'm let loose from the noose<br>
That's kept me hanging about<br><br>

I'm just looking at the sky 'cause it's getting me high<br>

'Cause I'm back on the track and I'm beating the flack<br>
Nobody's gonna get me on another rap<br>
So look at me now, I'm just making my play<br>
Don't try to push your luck, just get out of my way<br><br>
